# AsteroidsGame
Python Asteroids Game

Built with pygame, it is a side-scroller where the user moves up and down to avoid asteroid of various sizes. For 
the project, I integrated a high score, a boss section, and different sized asteroids inflicting different levels of damage.

The asteroids spawn at random heights based on a probability function related to how many asteroid are currently on the screen and their size.

Runs Python 2.7
